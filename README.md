# SPECIAL THANKS
This project is based on https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd. Many thanks to `tsl0922` and the community.
The frontend UI code was originated from `ttyd` project, and the ttyd binary inside the container also comes from `ttyd` project.

# This is a Kubernates Cloud-Shell (Web Terminal) Operator.

# Why cloudtty ?

Existing project `ttyd` already provides great feature to share terminal over the web.
But Kubernetes cloud native enviroment requires a way to run web-tty via `kubernetes` way ( running as pod, and generated by CRD).
So you can try cloudtty.
